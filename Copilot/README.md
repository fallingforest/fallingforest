# Github Copilot review

This is my review after nearly 1 month of usage with the latest Github Copilot X


## Advantages & Examples:

 - autocomplete codes
 - generate the next codes based on previous context, expression, and explanation comments.
 - generate all function code based on its name
 - fix error code
 - propose different solutions based on inline code, comments
 - can be used to explain codes in human language
 - with Github copilot chat beta, it brings the chatGPT GPT-3 model into the IDE
 - with one account, can be used on different repositories which are not on that registered Git account (purchase for one account but can use on multiple accounts)

## Disadvantages:

 - sometimes provide bad codes
 - sometimes can not understand codes
 - slower than code snippets
 - not as convenient as some autocomplete extensions
 - not using the latest GPT-4 model 


## Comparisons:

 - with SolarLint
 
  * better at code suggestion than SularLint
  * use much smaller disk/ram/cpu usage than SolarLint
  
 -  with TabNine(free)
 
  * better at code suggestion & code understanding
  * TabNine does not have a live chat
  * Tabnine can not generate code based on comments/function name
  
  + Tabnine has a better performance/faster code completion
  

## Use Cases:

  - With a project which needs to write anything from the beginning, Copilot have the most useful than any other
  - With the new feature required to understand previous code, it is not useful enough, but it has a Copilot chat to ask like ChatGPT
  - With old projects, it's worth too little to buy a subscription (10$/month)


## My thought:

  I think If we start a new project Especially with TypesScript/ Python, PHP, It will be the best option to quickly create the project to make it done.
  If we are currently on an old project, It is not worth purchasing it for.
  But because you can sign in to multiple accounts on IDE( VSCode), then you can use it on multiple things, for example, I purchased it for one account, but it can use along with another GitHub account as well.
  
  Recommend buying? 7.5-8/10
  If they update the Copilot chat to GPT4? 8.5-9/10
